# Abstract
# 
#    CORBA [CORBA] is the Common Object Request Broker Architecture
#    defined by the Object Management Group. This document defines the
#    schema for representing CORBA object references in an LDAP directory
#    [LDAPv3].
# 
# [trimmed]

# 3. Attribute Type Definitions
# 
#    The following attribute types are defined in this document:
# 
#        corbaIor
#        corbaRepositoryId
# 
# 3.1 corbaIor
# 
#    This attribute stores the string representation of the interoperable
#    object reference (IOR) for a CORBA object. An IOR is an opaque handle
#    for the object which contains the information necessary to locate the
#    object, even if the object is in another ORB.
# 
#    This attribute's syntax is 'IA5 String' and its case is
#    insignificant.
# 
#    ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.4.1.14
#     NAME 'corbaIor'
#     DESC 'Stringified interoperable object reference of a CORBA object'
#     EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
#     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
#     SINGLE-VALUE
#    )
# 
attributetype ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.4.1.14
	NAME 'corbaIor'
	DESC 'Stringified interoperable object reference of a CORBA object'
	EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
	SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26
	SINGLE-VALUE )

# 3.2 corbaRepositoryId
# 
#    Each CORBA interface has a unique "repository id" (also called "type
#    id") that identifies the interface.  A CORBA object has one or more
#    repository ids, one for each interface that it implements.
# 
#    The format of a repository id can be any string, but the OMG
#    specifies four standard formats:
# 
#       a. IDL-style
# 
#        IDL:Prefix/ModuleName/InterfaceName:VersionNumber
# 
#    For example, the repository id for the "NamingContext" in OMG's COS
#    Naming module is:  "IDL:omg.org/CosNaming/NamingContext:1.0".
# 
#       b. RMI-style
# 
#        RMI:ClassName:HashCode[:SUID]
# 
#    This format is used by RMI-IIOP remote objects [RMI-IIOP].
#    "ClassName" is the fully qualified name of the class (for example,
#    "java.lang.String"). "HashCode" is the object's hash code (that is,
#    that obtained by invoking the "hashCode()" method).  "SUID" is the
#    "stream unique identifier", which is a 64-bit number that uniquely
#    identifies the serialization version of the class; SUID is optional
#    in the repository id.
# 
#       c. DCE-style
# 
#        DCE:UUID
# 
#    This format is used for DCE/CORBA interoperability [CORBA-DCE].
#    "UUID" represents a DCE UUID.
# 
#       d. "local"
# 
#    This format is defined by the local Object Request Broker (ORB).
# 
#    The corbaRepositoryId attribute is a multivalued attribute; each
#    value records a single repository id of an interface implemented by
#    the CORBA object.  This attribute need not contain a complete list of
#    the interfaces implemented by the CORBA object.
# 
#    This attribute's syntax is 'Directory String' and its case is
#    significant.  The values of this attribute are encoded using UTF-8.
#    Some values may require translation from their native representation
#    in order to be correctly encoded using UTF-8.
# 
#    ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.4.1.15
#     NAME 'corbaRepositoryId'
#     DESC 'Repository ids of interfaces implemented by a CORBA object'
#     EQUALITY caseExactMatch
#     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
#    )
# 
#
